I applied Double Machine Learning techniques in Python to study the causal relationship between corruption and firm growth in Vietnam. I used pandas, NumPy, and pyjanitor to clean, merge, and harmonize multiple survey and administrative data sources into a panel dataset and to construct regression-ready variables. Estimation was carried out using  DML and CausalForestDML estimators, combined with scikit-learn models such as LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, and RandomForestRegressor. I implemented end-to-end workflows including K-fold cross-validation, train–test splits, and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, and leveraged built-in diagnostic tools to assess nuisance model performance and variable importance. This approach allowed me to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects and provided evidence that higher firm employment, used as a proxy for firm growth, is associated with lower levels of bribery intensity.
